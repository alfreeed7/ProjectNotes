<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p>
Our CSS is a dark, world travel themed design. We chose to go with a subtle theme, making use of dark blues and purples as our base colors
and lighter blues and white as highlights and text color. Also worth noting is the fact that we changed the opacity of the day box
backgrounds for aesthetic purposes. This We also made it a goal to center elements wherever practical. For accentuating
details, we included images that reinforce the travel theme, such as the header icons and the passport icon next to the profile picture.
Our choice of icons in the day boxes is also signficant. For past days, we used a mountain with a flag planted on it, showing that
we have completed days. The current day has a road, symbolizing a journey, and future days have a globe with a flight path, symbolizing
that it is our destination.
</p>
<p>
Our design includes multiple interactive features. Day boxes expand when the user hovers over them, and the header fades away as the user
scrolls down. Furthrermore, the links in the header and the day boxes both have their own unique effect when the user hovers over them.
